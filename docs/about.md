# About me

Hey there! I’m a Software Engineer who’s spent decades diving deep into software architecture, distributed computing, security, and automotive systems. I love tackling complex problems, designing scalable systems, and making sure things don’t just work—but work really well.

I enjoy working on challenging architectures, mentoring talented teams, and bringing people together across teams to build great things—smoothly and efficiently. While C++, Go, and Python are my primary working languages, I was lucky enough to get some production experience with Elixir—and honestly, it was a blast! There’s something about its elegant approach to functional programming and distributed systems that really resonates with me.

Outside of work, I’m a dedicated Vim enthusiast. My [Vim configuration](https://github.com/astavonin/configs/blob/master/nvim/init.vim) has been a labor of love for over a decade, constantly evolving to make my workflow as efficient and seamless as possible.

I’m also passionate about sharing knowledge—whether it’s through tech talks, open-source contributions, or just helping others level up. You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/astavonin/), browse my [GitHub](https://github.com/astavonin), or take a look at my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B6FkmPzpCt1JsvCKw_fOGAZDPGMYh91Rvph19mPAgjQ/edit?usp=sharing) to see what I’ve been up to.

When I’m not at my keyboard, I love traveling, capturing beautiful [nature shots](https://www.instagram.com/kaapython/) and [portraits](https://www.instagram.com/alexandveronika/), and spending time with my German Shepherd, [Molly](https://sysdev.me/old/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1.jpeg)—she brings so much joy to my life!
